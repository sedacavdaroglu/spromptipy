This is a small web app that takes in a singer/band's name and phone number and sends the most popular song of that singer/band in an sms message. 

## My thoughts on the exercise:
1) Overall, I really enjoyed it. Given that the example was written in Ruby, it probably could have been implemented a little faster in Ruby. But it was not so complicated in Python either. 
2) Time spent - 2-3 hours on coding - a little more on deploying on heroku. 
3) Things to be imporived given more time - The web application as it is now has the basic features requested but given more time, I would add test modules to check if the band name and the phone number are entered correctly, if the spotify API returns the output in the right format etc. I would also work a little bit more on the aesthethics of the page to make it more user friendly.
